# Student Performance Analysis for Academic Success

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the socio-economic factors that influence the academic performance of secondary school students. Using the [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance), we explore relationships between various features like parental education, alcohol consumption, and student grades. The goal is to build a model that can predict student performance and provide insights into the key factors that lead to academic success.

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance)
- Attributes: Demographic information, school-related features, grades in Mathematics and Portuguese, and socio-economic factors like alcohol consumption, family status, and parental education.

## Key Features
- **G3**: Final grade (target variable)
- **Medu / Fedu**: Mother's/Father's education level
- **Walc**: Weekend alcohol consumption
- **Dalc**: Workday alcohol consumption
- **Failures**: Number of past class failures

## Project Structure
1. **Business Understanding**: Focus on the importance of understanding factors that influence academic success.
2. **Data Understanding**: Exploration of the dataset to understand patterns and relationships.
3. **Data Preparation**: Feature engineering and selection of relevant attributes for modeling.
4. **Modeling**: Training machine learning models to predict student grades.
5. **Evaluation**: Model performance metrics and insights.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into how socio-economic factors influence student grades and identifies key predictors of academic success. The results can help educators and policymakers make informed decisions regarding student support and intervention strategies.
